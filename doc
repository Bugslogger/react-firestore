React Firebase
In this video we will see CURD operation with firebase in reactjs.

So, watch full video till end.
we are going to use Firestore to store and modify data.

we will see everythign step to step.

Step 1:
a. Create react (I have alreaddy create a react app. so, now i will run it.) app and run it.
it will run the application on localhost:300.
b. goto firebase console create a project on firebase. follow the steps carefully and watch till end.

Step 2:
after firebase project is created.

    a. configure firebase in our react application. [let me delete all files from react app which we are not going to use.]

    b. must install firebase [npm install firebase run this command to install firebase.].
        here i'm installing bootstrap also for creating UI. now let goto our firebase console.

        I don't why it is happening. so, i will use another project on firebase which i have already created.
    c. After enabeling the firestore it look exactly same as you saw right now.
        you have to change rules to true. [ allow read, write: if true; ] this rule you have to apply. after applying this rule you don't need to authenticate.
    d. Goto firebase project settings and copy the configuration. and paste it in react app.
        follow the steps aas shown in video.we have configured our react app with firebase.

Step 3:
Create firebase functions and add/send/store data to firebase firestore.
In previous video we have installed firebase in our reactjs.
Now let test our function.

    a. In next step we will take input from form and send it to firebase.

Step 4:
get data from form and send to firebase.
Great! we have seen how to send data to firebase database with custom Id and auto generated id.

# Get All data from firebase firestore.

Step 5:
a. get all data from firestore database.
create a function for fetching all data from firestore database.
I don't know why it's not displaying. but we will see it later.
b. get data with custom ID. let create a function for it.

    we have seen How to get data from using ID and get all data from firestore databse and map it.

    we can also check it doc(data) exist in firestore database or not.
    let see it in code.

    In next video we will update data. for now share and subscribe. :)

# Update data in firestore database

1. send data firebase
2. get data from firestore database and display on web page
3. update data stored in firestore database

# [for send/get data from firestore I have already create video on this 2 topics. You can watch it.]

Let start....
I have already create a basic UI. A Input and a button.

step 1: write code to get text from input and send it to firestore database.
step 2: let test it. First let map the data.
there's already one data is available which is displaying on the screen.

step 3: send text to database.
step 4: now let update the data existing data.
add a firebase function for updating data.

    Now we can update the data in firestore database.

## In next video we will see how to delete data from database.
